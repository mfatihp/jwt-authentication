# JWT Authentication Microservice

A distributed authentication and authorization system built using FastAPI and JWT tokens. This project includes an `auth_service` for user management and token handling, and an `app_service` that uses JWT validation to authorize access to protected resources. Designed with modularity, security, and Docker-based deployment in mind.

## ðŸ§± Architecture

- **auth_service**: Handles user registration, login, token creation, refresh token handling.
- **app_service**: Validates JWT access tokens for protected endpoints.
- **auth_db**: Used by auth service to store user data, email and hashed password.
- **app_db**: Used by both services to store user data and email.
